       <h3 style="color: rgb(7, 7, 7); font-size: 25px;"> When the sun scorches down on our backs, mangoes and watermelons flood the market and complaints about the weather become a pastime in most households, you know summer has arrived! With temperatures soaring we see a huge increase in cases of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat related illnesses like these happen when the body is not able to cool itself properly by just sweating and the rise in temperature is substantially higher than the rate of cooling. This can lead to brain damage, organ failure and other serious conditions.
       
       Heat strokes can happen to athletes and active people involved in vigorous physical activity (exertional heat stroke) and elderly or sick people (non exertional heat stroke). Obesity, alcohol consumption, prescription drugs and dehydration are high risk factors. Whether you are a competitive athlete, student, working professional or senior citizen, it is extremely important to stay safe in the heat by making simple lifestyle changes.</h3>
